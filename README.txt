Scrabble
--------

This program allows the user to enter state of a Scrabble board and available
letters, and it searches for possible words to place.
Use arrows to move the cursor and press a letter to place it. Press space bar to
remove a letter. To move the cursor from board to hand and vice-versa, press
tabulator.
To make the program search for possible words, press enter. Found possibilities
will be printed to the console.
Upon launch, you can specify a file that will be used as the source of valid
words. Each line must contain one word. For details, invoke the program with the
`--help` flag. If no file is specified, the default file is `words.txt`.
